# Discussion
> Concepts of vector space and basis are important to understand this week.  The important goal in ML is to discover the best basis set to describe the input dataset and to solve ML problem. Let's discuss: When a vector can be a basis for a vector subspace?

## Vector Subspaces and Basis

Based on the lecture and quiz, there are three requirements that must be satisfied for a vector to be a basis for a vector subspace:

1. **Spans the space**  
2. **Is linearly independent**  
3. **Has exactly _n_ elements**, where _n_ is the dimension of the finite-dimensional space ℝⁿ  
   (for example, in the quiz, set **S** was a subset of **V**, a 5-dimensional vector space or ℝ⁵, which means that **S** must have 5 elements)

Now here are some concepts that I clarified when solving for question 5 in the quiz:

<ins> Subspace </ins>

The problem stated how "**S is a subset of V**". I was initially confused because I assumed that if **S** is a subset of **V**, it must have fewer than 5 elements.

However, after further research, I realized that there are **two types of subsets**:
* **Proper Subset**: Has fewer elements than the vector space. _Notation_: `A ⊂ B`
* **Improper Subset**: Has exactly the same elements as the vector space. _Notation_: `A = B`

<ins> What does it mean for the vectors in the set to be linearly independent? </ins>

There are no vectors in the set (i.e., the basis set) that can be written as a linear combination of the others. So none of the vectors in the set are linearly dependent on one another.

<ins> What does it mean for basis vectors to span a vector space? </ins>

It means that the basis vectors can be used to construct every vector in that space via linear combinations. So basically, the vectors in the basis form an **independent set** of vectors that can be used to create a system of linear equations with a unique solution (independent system of linear equations) for any vector in the space.
