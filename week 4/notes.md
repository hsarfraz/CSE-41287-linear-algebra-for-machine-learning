<ins>Key Terms talked about in a video</ins> [link to youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7RM-ot2NWY)
* Basis vectors
* Linear Combination of Vectors
* Span of vectors
* Linearly Independent and Dependent vectors

# Discussion
* Pivot columns
* **Subspace**: A subset of a vector space.
     * A proper subset has fewer elements than the vector space.
     * A improper subset has exactly the same elements as the vector space.
* Span
* Additbity & Homogeneity
* Dilation (scaling)
* **L2 Norm (aka the Euclidean norm)**: The length or distance from the orgin
* **Null Space**: When you multiply a matrix by a vector and the output is a zero vector
* Contradiction or no contradictions in a matrix in reduced row echelon form (RREF)
* **Orthogonal vectors**: When the dot product of two vectors is zero
* **Basis of a vector space**: Satisfies 3 conditions
    * spans the space
    * is linearly independent
    * has exactly n elements where n is the dimension of the spaces
