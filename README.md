## week 2 Key take aways
* A matrix is a 2D array with multiple rows and columns
* A vector is a 1D array. It can be thought of as a matrix with only one row or one column
* A scalar is just a single number â€” no rows, no columns. A scaler can be used to scale a vector or matrix (e.g., multiply every element by 2)
