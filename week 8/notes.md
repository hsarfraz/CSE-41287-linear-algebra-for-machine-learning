> The assignment README file instructions will guide you, there will be 3 plots generated. To get the full mark it is enough to submit the assignment table,  adding plots and your matlab scripts would be nice. The goal of the assignment is to inspire you to think how learning rate and number of iterations affect the final ML model. Using small practical example is easier to understand and  conceptually to generalize. Feel free to play with alpha and number of iterations. 
The learning rate "alpha" can be changed from default value 0.07 to bigger value, on example 0.1. 

How is changing learning rate "alpha" going to influence your linear regression model?
